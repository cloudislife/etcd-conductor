Procedure:
- command execution start;
- at this moment, new node is still present in inventory file
- data about new node is obtained from inventory file;

- first we notify cluster of the upcoming node removal:
---> this is done by running the script on all existing nodes;
---> script exits if node is not cluster leader;
---> only on leader the etcdctl command is executed, and leader then
        notifies other cluster members about departing node;

- on departing node:
---> stop etcd
---> destroy data directory

- a rolling reconfiguration+restart is done to update configuration files
    on all existing nodes.

All done.
