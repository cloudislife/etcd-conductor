### Steps to add new node as a member of the cluster
###

Step 1:

    Configure new node variables in inventory file (hosts), but comment it out
    with '#new ' prefix at the very beginning of line, like this:

#new new-node.etcd.example.net   etcd_node_ip=X.X.X.X   etcd_node_name_fqdn=new-node.etcd.example.net   etcd_node_name_short=new-node



Step 2:

    Run:
        ./bin/add-new-node   NEW_NODE_NAME

### Description of process that follows
###
#
# This might be useful if something happens during the process and manual
# intervention is needed.
#

Procedure:
- command execution start;
- at this moment, new node is commented-out in our inventory file;
- data about new node is obtained from inventory file;

- first we notify cluster of the upcoming node:
---> this is done by running the script on all existing nodes;
---> script exits if node is not cluster leader;
---> only on leader the etcdctl command is executed, and leader then
        notifies other cluster members about new node;

- '#new ' prefix is removed from this entry in inventory file, making it a
    valid cluster member;
- a datadir purge is done on the new node, just in case;
- new node gets final configuration and etcd is (re)started

- a rolling reconfiguration+restart is done to update configuration files
    on all existing nodes.

All done.
